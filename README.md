# Lending Club Case Study
> The aim of this case study is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of the loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. In this case study, we have used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## General Information
- Lending Club Case Study is a group case study project done to draw insights from the company's dataset.
- A consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers wants to know if the loan applicant is likely to repay the loan or not.
- Business Problem:
  1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
  2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- The dataset we have used here is "loan.csv"

## Conclusions
- Loan Terms: The longer term of the loan has an impact on charge-off rates.
- Interest Rate: Higher interest rates could lead to higher default rates.
- Employment Length: Individuals with shorter employment histories are riskier borrowers.
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Higher DTI may indicate a higher risk of default.
- Purpose Loan: Smaller companies can result in charge-off.
